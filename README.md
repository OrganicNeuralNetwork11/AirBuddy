Air Buddy drone project

Long endurance (60-minute flight time) VTOL aircraft with autonomous solar recharging in between flights during missions. Control bay will allow live external sensor, video, and system-status telemetry to ground station via radio link or GSM data packets. Sensor payload will contain optical sensors that can record high-definition photo and video for surveillance, surveying and ISR (Intelligence Support Reconnaissance) during day and night.
Flight profile will be approximately 1-meter total wingspan and approximately 1 meter in length. System should be able to withstand minor winds and water.
